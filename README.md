# Student Data Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is an interactive **Student Data Analysis System** built using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit**.

It allows users to explore, analyze, and extract insights from a student dataset through a simple and user-friendly interface.

The system performs complete **data analysis (EDA)** and provides multiple options for users to perform their own customized analysis.
